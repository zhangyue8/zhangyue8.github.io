        <p id="content">I adopted a kitten at Christmas last year. </br> But in fact, it is not me who chooses cats, but cats who choose me. </br>Dogs are not the same as cats. Dogs treat you as a boss, but cats want to see your resume first.</br>
            I named him Marble because his fur is very much like marble. </br>When he was asleep he was very good, like an angel, but when he woke up, he is a demon.</p>
