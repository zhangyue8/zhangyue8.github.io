        <h1 id="header">I Have My Own Cat!</h1>
        <p id="content">I adopted a kitten at Christmas last year. But in fact, it is not me who chooses cats, but cats who choose me. Dogs are not the same as cats. Dogs treat you as a boss, but cats want to see your resume first.
            I named him Marble because his fur is very much like marble. When he was asleep he was very good, like an angel, but when he woke up, he looked like a demon.</p>
