            <h1>A Little Fun about Chinese Characters</h1>
            <div class="intro">
                <p>I have a lot of friends who are interested in Chinese characters, but their Chinese learning is not persistent. Because they think Chinese characters are too difficult!<br/><br/>
                    
                    But in fact, there are skills to learning Chinese characters. As is known to all, Chinese characters are a kind of pictograph evolved from graphics, although after many years, 
                    the structure of Chinese characters continue to simplify, but we can still find from the body of Chinese characters as a graphic traces.<br/><br/>

                    So my first advice is to remember Chinese characters as little emojis!

                    You can see that the Chinese character stands on two legs. How real it is!</p>
                <p>The second interesting Chinese character rule is the Radical.<br/>
                    The radicals also evolved from independent Chinese characters, Chinese characters carrying the same radical will have a similar meaning.<br/><br/>

                    For example:<br/>
                    <b style="color: rgb(102, 158, 37);">花</b> and <b style="color: rgb(102, 158, 37);">草</b> both have similar top structures: " <b style="color: rgb(102, 158, 37);">艹</b> ".<br/>
                    " <b style="color: rgb(102, 158, 37);">艹</b> " represents "grass/plant".<br/>
                    <b style="color: rgb(102, 158, 37);">花</b> => "flower".   <b style="color: rgb(102, 158, 37);">草</b> => "grass".<br/><br/>
                    There are many Chinese characters in the pool below! <b>But don't panic!</b> <br/>
                    I have some tips to help you better understand how to use the pool.

                    <li>Select a Radical in the select box.</li><br/>
                    <li>You'll notice that there are fewer characters in the pool than before, and they all have the same radicals. Try clicking on the circle with Chinese characters.</li><br/>
                    <li>Is it zoomed in again? Try clicking on the character again and you will find more information!</li>
