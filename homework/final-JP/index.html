                        <p>Japan, "the land of the rising sun", is a highly developed capitalist country in Asia despite its small size.<br/>
                            But this island nation on the western coast of the Pacific Ocean, with four large islands and 6,800 smaller ones, is known as the land of a thousand islands.<br/>
                            But Japan has been plagued by earthquakes and tsunamis.
                            By maps, Japan in the Pacific northwest, the eastern part of Eurasia, is a four including Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu island and other more than 6800 small islands "thousand island country".<br/>
                            At the same time also is a mountainous country, the central mountain ridge shape distribution in Japan.<br/>
                            Japan's territory segmentation of on one side of the Pacific Ocean and the seaside, so mountainous and hilly area of Japan is very big.<br/>
                            But most of these mountains are volcanic (Japan has the world one over ten of the total), the highest of which is Mount Fuji (also a volcano).

                        <h2>Why is Japan prone to earthquakes?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Japan sits on the most active seismic belt in the world, the Pacific ring of earthquakes.<br/>
                            Earthquake, also known as ground motion, ground vibration, is the crust of the rapid release of energy caused by the process of vibration, during the earthquake waves that will produce a natural phenomenon. <br/>
                            The main cause of earthquakes is the collision between the plates and the edges of the plates.<br/>
                            Earthquake began to occur at the site known as the source, the source is above the ground known as the epicenter. <br/>
                            The ground of destructive earthquake vibration is the strongest place called extremely seismic area, extremely seismic area is often the epicenter of the area. <br/>
                            Earthquake often cause serious casualties, can cause fire, flood, toxic gas leakage, bacteria, and radioactive materials spread, may also cause tsunami, landslide, collapse, cracks and other secondary disasters.<br/>
                            According to statistics, the earth every year about more than 5 million earthquakes, that is, every day to have tens of thousands of earthquakes. <br/>
                            Most are too small or too far away to be felt; There are about ten or twenty earthquakes that can cause serious harm to human beings. <br/>
                            There are about one or two earthquakes that can cause particularly severe damage. <br/>
                            Earthquakes that cannot be felt must be recorded with seismometers. Different types of seismometers can record earthquakes of different intensities at different distances. <br/>
                            Thousands of different kinds of seismic instruments operate around the world to monitor the movement of earthquakes day and night.<br/>
