            <div>
                <p>In the north of China, the air quality is very poor for the following reasons</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The mining industry</li>
                    <p>Northern China is a traditional heavy industrial region. Heavy industry as a local pillar industry has made great contributions to the local economy. If the government forces enterprises to reduce emissions in order to protect the environment, it will cause local economic losses</p>
                    <li>The heating system</li>
                    <p>In the north of China, there is a central heating system which burns coal for heating. So the air pollution in northern China is especially bad in winter.<br>Winter: October to January is the heating system heating period.</p>
                    <li>Terrain factors</li>
                    <p>Surrounded by mountains in the north of China, the terrain is complicated and the air is stagnant. During the northern hemisphere winter, winds from Siberia can't keep the air flowing in the northern cities.</p>
                    <li>The traditional customs</li>
                    <p>There are two important Chinese festivals in winter, one is the Spring Festival, the other is the qingming festival. During the Chinese New Year, it is the custom in the north to set off fireworks, which will produce a lot of harmful chemical gases. During the qingming festival, Chinese people burn colorful papers to commemorate their ancestors, which also causes a lot of pollution.</p>
