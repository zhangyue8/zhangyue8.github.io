                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. It was first identified in China and spreading to the whole world very quickly.
                    <br>
                    I chose the four countries with the largest number of confirmed cases to compare their growth rates, and they were China, U.S., Italy, and Spain (now it has become U.S., Spain, Italy, and France).<br>

                    I don't think one death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic. I think a million deaths mean a million broken families. I feel sad by many unfortunate stories and hope that humans will learn from this.
